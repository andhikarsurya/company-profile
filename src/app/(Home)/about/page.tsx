                    Mojang was initially a small independent game studio. Markus Persson, also known as Notch, had already created a small indie game called Minecraft, which quickly gained a cult following. The games success led to the formation of Mojang as a company, with Persson focusing on the development and expansion of Minecraft.

                    In 2010, the games alpha version was released to the public. It was initially a simple, sandbox-style game with a unique pixelated art style and block-building mechanics. The game grew in popularity through community feedback, frequent updates, and engaging mechanics like crafting and survival mode.

                    As Minecraft grew, Mojang saw significant success, attracting millions of players worldwide. However, in 2014, the company was acquired by Microsoft for $2.5 billion. Despite this acquisition, Mojang continued to operate as an independent studio within Microsoft, with the Minecraft franchise remaining a core part of its portfolio.

                    <p className="my-[1rem] ml-[1rem]">
                    After the acquisition, the team expanded further, and Mojang continued to develop new content for Minecraft, including additional game versions, spin-offs like Minecraft Dungeons, and major updates to enhance the gaming experience.

                    Mojang Studios also focused on enhancing the community and player creativity, maintaining the open-world, sandbox-style gameplay that allows players to build and create freely. The studio also worked on expanding Minecraft through partnerships, such as with LEGO for Minecraft LEGO sets and educational tools.
